# flutter_contact_picker

With this plugin a Flutter app can ask its user to select a contact from his/her address book. The information associated with the contact is returned to the app.

This plugin uses the operating system's native UI for selecting contacts and does not require any special permissions from the user.

Currently, the plugin only supports picking phone numbers. However, it should be easy to extend the plugin to request other properties from a contact (e.g. addresses) or to obtain the entire record of a contact (PRs are welcome).
